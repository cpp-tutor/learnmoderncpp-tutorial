The first parameter is the (writable) iterator pointing to the start of the array, and the second is the maximum number of characters to write. The return value has an `out` data member which is the iterator pointing to the next character in the array, which needs to be set to zero in order to allow putting (`std::array`'s, not `std::string`'s) `data()` to `wcout`.\n",
