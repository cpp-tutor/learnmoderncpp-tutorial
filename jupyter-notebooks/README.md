## Jupyter Notebooks

The complete Tutorial is available as a set of Jupyter Notebooks listed above. Please note that they are intended for use with JupyterLab or [Google Colab](https://colab.google)&mdash;it is possible to preview them on GitHub but the interactive features will not be present. (Save and upload after viewing raw, or copy the address to paste by clicking on the "chain".) Also, the formatting of some parts does not render correctly at first, use Ctrl-Enter after clicking in a non-displaying "text" block to correct this, or press "play" after clicking within the block. Finally, note that the notebooks are intended for use with the `cpp23` kernel which allows code to be executed (possibly after modification), which is available from Python's pip package "jupyter-cpp-kernel".
