    "We have become familiar with the `main()` function, which is automatically called (or *entered*) when the program starts. Variables defined within `main()` have been called local variables because they are local to the scope of `main()`. Importantly, they are **not** visible within any functions called by `main()`, even though they retain their state between such calls. The following program defines three variables and also three functions (one of which is `main()`); these three variables have the same name, but different types and values. The values of each of these variables are only accessible within the functions they are defined in, that is: the variables are only *visible* within their own defining function's *scope*."

The value thus returned is known as the *return value*; its type is the *return type* of the function.  In case of `auto`, the return type is deduced from the entity (entities) after the `return` statement(s); if there is more than one they must return values of the same type.

This causes a return value of zero (which indicates successful execution) to be returned to the calling environment or process; this value is sometimes called the *return code* of a program. Other values are used to indicate different error conditions encountered; a return code of either zero or non-zero is allowed at any point within `main()`, including at the end.\n",
