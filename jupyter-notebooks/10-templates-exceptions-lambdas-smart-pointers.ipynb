There may be multiple catch-blocks following the try-block, each introducing its own scope, and the first (and only) one of these which matches the type thrown is entered.

    "The member function `reset()` changes the object owned by the `std::unique_ptr`; calling `reset(nullptr)` releases and destroys the object early. Also, `std::unique_ptr`s cannot be copied as this would make no semantic sense (a deep copy cannot be initiated by a pointer-to-object, and a shallow copy would mean either shared ownership or dangling pointers). They can however be moved, either explicitly using `std::move` or as a return value from a function (they are very useful as return types for factory functions).\n",

Luckily there is a third smart pointer type `std::weak_ptr`, a non-owning smart pointer which can be initialized from a `std::shared_ptr`.

This lambda needs to capture `AllClasses` and `AllPupils` by reference, and iterates through these with a *predicate* lambda that returns a `bool`. It is worthwhile becoming familiar with this syntax, `std::find()` was used in Chapter 7.\n",
