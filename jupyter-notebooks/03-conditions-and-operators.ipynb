    "The programs we have seen in the previous two chapters have been a little predictable in how they run, as they have a *linear execution path* through the `main()` function. Such simple programs have very little practical use. More complex programs, which alter their *control flow* based on *user input* fall into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Batch programs* take all of their input at the beginning of their execution, usually from any or all of: program parameters, an environment variable(s), or an input file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Interactive programs* enact a dialog with the *user* (the computer operator) while the program is executing. This dialog is often two-way as the user is not necessarily expected to know what input is required without being prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive programs often use either a console or a *GUI* (Graphical User Interface, historically found on desktop computers, but more often found these days on tablets and smartphones). Interactive console programs often produce output to the console *interleaved* with user input, while batch programs ususally know all of their input at the beginning of their execution and produce all of their output following this with no further user involvement or action. As an example of a modern alternative, a purely voice-activated device (possibly without a screen) has an interface which interestingly has more in common with an interactive console program than with a GUI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously we have enountered `print()` and `println()` for putting formatted output to the console. Interestingly, there is currently no direct equivalent in Modern C++ for reading input. The `getline()` functions are not covered until Chapter 7, and as might be guessed from the name read a textual string which must then be processed further in order to obtain a valid value for numerical (or similar) input. For reasons of simplicity, this Chapter only covers the use of *stream objects* for reading from and writing to the console, and use if these requires the `<iostream>` header.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick introduction to the stream output object `cout` (an abbreviation of \"Character Output\"), string literals, character literals, numeric (and other) values and variables are \"put to\" the console using (possibly multiple) occurrencies of `<<` (the *stream insertion operator*). There is no format string as such, the output is created from the object to the right of each `<<`, in order from left to right. For example:"

The following program outputs a message inviting the user to enter a number, and then prints this number out again on the console. Before `cin` is used, the variable to be used to accept the input into must have already been defined so that the type of the required input can be deduced. Providing an initial value is preferred (empty braces give it the default value, zero in this case) in case the read by `cin` fails due to either invalid input, such as the user typing letters where digits were required, or end-of-input (Ctrl-D, or Ctrl-Z under Windows):"

In fact, the variable `alice_age` can be set to any value that can be held by type `int`; however the number must (usually) be entered as a decimal; the prefixes for binary, octal and hexadecimal are by default only interpreted at compile-time for literals within program code, or by conversion functions such as `from_chars()`.\n",

    "An extension to the `if` and `switch` conditional expression syntax is to precede the conditional expression with an initializer and a semi-colon. In fact this is quite flexible, just about any legal C++ expression can be used. The scope of a variable defined in such an initializer has the scope of both the `if` **and** `else` clauses (if present) for an `if` statement, and the `switch` body when used with a `switch` statement.\n",

    "C++ has quite a lot of operators, many of which are inherited from C and operate on the built-in types in exactly the same ways. Some are unary (operate on one value) while others are binary (operate on two values). Unary operators exist which are prefix (written before the object) or postfix (written after the object) and two (`++` and `--`) are both. Binary operators are exclusively infix (written between the two objects they operate on). There is also exactly one ternary operator (which we have seen in this Chapter, the conditional operator), which operates on three values. Some operators are left-to-right associative and others are right-to-left associative, except for the scope resolution operator and comparison operators which are non-associative.\n",
