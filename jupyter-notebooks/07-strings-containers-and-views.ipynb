    "Whilst support for read-only string literals is built into C++, we must make use of the Standard Library when we want a string-type which is be able to be manipulated and compared, using operators such as `+` (concatenation) and `==` (equality comparison). The `std::string` type supports all of the operations you would expect to be present, such as concatenation, indexing, sub-string extraction, comparisons and reporting the length. All of the memory management operations necessary are taken care of automatically at run-time; string objects are allowed to use heap memory and interestingly do not use any \"special\" features of the language not available to the application programmer.\n",

    "\n",
    "* We start with an empty `std::vector`, this means that the `int` element type **must** be specified (within angle brackets) as it cannot be otherwise deduced. This type is fixed at compile-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A \"forever\" loop with local variable `i` is used to avoid the need for either multiple `cout` statements (which would be code duplication) or a do-while loop (which would most likely cause `99` to be appended to the `vector`, which we don't want).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `push_back()` member function of `vector` is used to make `i` the new last element, this \"grows\" the container automatically as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The *Standard Libary algorithm* `std::sort()` gets all of the information about the `vector` that it needs in order to operate from the two iterators provided as parameters. (It can be relied upon to be an efficient algorithm, probably performing better than any hand-written code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instead of a traditional or range-for loop, a second algorithm `std::copy()` is used. As might be guessed this copies everything from the first iterator up to, but not including, the second iterator to its third parameter, which is actually an *output iterator*. There is no \"magic\" involved, all you need to understand is that a `std::output_iterator` *object* takes a single type of its output between triangular brackets (here it is `int`) and the output stream and optional delimiter are specified as parameters. (This is boilerplate code that can be reused in your own programs, possibly with different types and delimiters.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Type `99` as the first input value. Does the program crash? Does this surprise you? Check that `v` is `empty()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Modify the program to print out the highest numbers first. Hint: use `crbegin()` and `crend()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change to using a range-for loop instead of `std::copy()` to output the `vector`. Hint: use `const auto&`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use member functions `begin()` and `end()` in the call to `std::sort()`. Does the compile to the same thing? Which style do you prefer?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rewrite the second `for`-loop using an index variable and subscript access. Do you still prefer this form?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many member functions belonging to `std::vector` and the other standard containers, and even experienced C++ programmers don't remember them all. There are even more (over 100) function templates (algorithms) which operate with the standard containers through iterators; where there is a choice between both the member function should be used as this will be specialized for the container type. There is almost never a need to write a mini-algorithm which operates within a loop over the elements of a container, as would be needed in C or with built-in arrays; they have been implemented in the Standard Library ready for you to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you reach for a container, `std::vector` is often the best fit, and should be your natural first choice. Should you decide that one of the other container types is needed, this would usually be a design decision made early in the development of your program. There is uniformity in the naming of the member functions, so all containers support `clear()`, for example. However as soon as you delve into the implementation details, such similarity appears superficial. It is important to have a basic understanding of the implementation of each container so that their individual advantages and limitations are understood, in order for the correct one to be chosen and used effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, consider the use of `std::find()` versus member function `find()` when using `std::string`, `std::vector` and `std::set`; this function finds the first occurence of its parameter in the specified container. The `std::set` container is similar to `std::vector` except that it maintains its elements in sorted order. The differences are:\n",

    "\n",
    "* For `std::set`, member function `find()` returns an **iterator** having performed a *binary search* (repeatedly dividing the range of values in half). This is quicker than using `std::find()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For `std::string`s if the search criterion is not found, special value `std::string::npos` is returned (\"no position\"), whilst the iterator which indicates not found is `end()` (**not** `nullptr` or zero). The following program demonstrates this:"

    "\n",
    "* The `std::map` called `products` is initialized from a nested initializer list, and the key/value types are specified within the angle brackets. The output of floating point numbers is fixed to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With user option `A`, member function `insert()` is called with a (temporary) `std::pair`. This is usually preferred over using array syntax, while `products[product] = price` would work in most cases it is not the most efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With user option `C`, all of the products are printed out by a range-for loop which iterates over `products` and outputs the `first` and `second` fields of each element. Then member function `find()` is called to obtain an iterator. This is compared against `end(products)` (which if equal would indicate \"not found\"), a valid value allows the value as `iter->second` to be retrieved.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `std::queue` implements a FIFO (First In First Out)\n",
