So which is more accurate: `Pixel` is-a `Point` (with a color), or `Pixel` has-a `Point` (and a color)? Personally, I think the first one is a better description, and would suggest that *is-a* inheritance should be used wherever practical to do so. In Chapter 9 we will meet inheritance again when describing more complex classes.\n",

    "We have seen that the `struct Point` fields defined as `int x{}, y{};` can be acessed as member variables of objects using dot-notation such as `p1.x` and `p1.y`. Changing the types of `x` and/or `y` (to `double` for example) does not cause any problems, but renaming the fields to something different causes a compilation error as we would be trying to reference former members of `Point` which no longer exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our `struct Point` is said to have *zero encapsulation*; its internals are open to public view, inspection and modification. Sometimes this is acceptable, but more often we want to *separate implementation from interface*. Use of member functions can be a way to provide an interface between the *user* of a type (the programmer who uses objects of that user-defined type) and the *implementor* of that type (the programmer who created the user-defined type). This interface is a *contract* between the two, which should always be considered and designed carefully.\n",

The following program is our, by now familiar, `Point` type with three member functions (sometimes called *methods* in other programming languages) defined in the body of the `struct` definition, that is, within the braces. These functions can read and write the values of the member variables `x` and `y`, and logically enough are known as *getters* and *setters*. They are said to be defined *inline* when written in full between the braces of the `struct` definition, and as such are often automatically inlined by the compiler. This means that there may well be no function call overhead, so performance considerations should not be a reason to disregard encapsulation. (Types with methods are ususally known as classes in other languages, from now on we will use this word to mean any C++ composite type declared with `struct` or `class`, except for `enum class`.)"

    "A few things to note about this program:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The member functions appear before the member variables in the definition of `Point`; this is just a convention since members can in most cases appear in any order. The member function names have been written in *camelCase* which is a common convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The member variables `x` and `y` are in scope for all of the member functions, so there is no need to fully qualify them as `this->x` and `this->y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The member function returns both `x` and `y` as a `std::pair`. The `auto` return type is used (it's actually `std::pair<int,int>`) and is declared `const` between the (empty) parameter list and the function body. The use of `const` in this context means the member function promises not to modify any member variables (in other words, the object's own state). The important concept of `const` correctness for member functions is to declare them `const` whenever they do not modify the object, thus enabling for objects which are themselves constants (such as `const Point`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The *access specifier* `private:` is used before the member variables `x` and `y` which means that code outside the scope of `Point` (such as in `main()`) cannot use them; they must use the getter and setters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The variable `p` of type `Point` in `main()` is default-initialized, other variants such as `Point p{ 0, 1 };` are not possible (due to `x` and `y` being `private:`), this would need a class constructor to be written (see Chapter 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `int`s `user_x`, `user_y`, `px` and `py` are all defined local to `main()`. The member access operator `.` is used as in `p.setX(user_x);` to call the member functions; this is another use of dot-notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The return type of member function `getXY()` is read into `px` and `py` using aggregate initialization, and these variables are outputted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a function `setXY()` which modifies both member variables of `Point`, and use this instead of `setX()` and `setY()` in `main()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write two functions `moveByX()` and `moveByY()` which add their parameter's value to the `x` and `y` members respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change `pair` to `tuple` in `getXY()`. Does the code still compile? What does this indicate about the generality of aggregate initialization from return types?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try to modify `x` within `getXY()`. What happens? Now try to return a modified `x` such as `x+1` instead. What happens now? Try both of these having removed the `const` qualifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change the name of `x` to `super_x` at all occurencies within `Point`, remebering to change all of the member functions which use `x` too. Does the code compile without any changes to `main()`? What does this tell you about another advantage of separating implementation from interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Static members\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of a class definition, `static` member variables (sometimes called *class variables*) are similar to global variables, in that there is only one *instance*. They are said to be *per-class* as opposed to *per-object*; regardless of how many objects of a `struct` (or `class`) there are, there can be only one instance of any `static` member. Also they are referred to outside of the `struct` definition with a double colon operator (`::`), not dot-notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following program extends the `Point` class with two `static` member constants. The member functions `setX()` and `setY()` have been modified, try to guess what they now do from the code:"

If `screenX` and `screenY` could be modified directly, this would no longer be the case, and a setter/getter pair (or similar) should be created. (A similar rule relaxation is allowing global *constants*, as opposed to *variables*, without restriction as neither data-races nor accidental/erroneous reassignment can occur with constants.)\n",

Is it easily possible to maintain the invariants of this type for `Point`s already created, that is existing `Point`s that are now outside the screen area?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operator overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many operators in C++ and most of these can be adapted (or *overloaded*) to work with user-defined types. (Operators for built-in types are not able to be redefined.) Like many other features of the language, their availability and flexibility should be approached with some degree of restraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator oveloading works in a similar way to function overloading, so some familiarity with this concept is assumed. C++ resolves operator calls to user-defined types to function calls, so that `r = a X b` is resolved to `r = operator X (a, b)`. (This is a slight simplification; where `a` is a user-defined type, the member function `r = a.operator X (b)` is used in preference, if available.)\n",
