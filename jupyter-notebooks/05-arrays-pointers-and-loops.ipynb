    "## Number and character arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "A C++ array can be described as a collection of entities *of the same type* arranged *contiguously* in memory. C++ inherits its *built-in array* syntax from C, sometimes these are referred to as *C-style* arrays. Uniform initialization syntax can be used to assign the contents of an array at the point it is defined (and **only** at this point). This is called *aggregate initialization* using a *braced initializer* (the equals sign shown below is in fact optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "int numbers[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the type is `int[]` (\"array of `int`\"), however the square brackets *bind* to the variable name, in this case `numbers`, not to the type specifier, in this case `int`. The optional number between the square brackets (which must be a **constant** known at compile-time) is the length of the array; this is fixed at compile-time and cannot be changed at run-time. If no value is provided here then it is calculated from the number of *elements* which make up the initializer (in this case the value is 5). The array size must be **at least** as large as the initializer being assigned from, otherwise a compile-time error is produced. If the size of the array is given as greater than the number of elements in the initializer, the remaining elements are default-constructed (zeroized for the built-in types).\n",
    "\n",
    "The array variable `numbers` is writable through subscripting syntax using square brackets `[` and `]`. The array index starts at **zero** (`[0]`) for the first element. Attempting to read or write beyond the last element is undefined behavior, as is use of negative indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "numbers[4] = 6;       // ok, numbers[] is { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 }\n",
    "numbers[5] = 99;      // not ok, compiles but yields undefined behavior\n",
    "auto i = numbers[0];  // ok, i is 1\n",
    "auto j = numbers[-1]; // not ok, compiles but yields undefined behavior\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A string literal can be thought of as simply an array of characters, thus a string literal can be used to initialize an array of `char`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "char name[] = \"Dinah\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of array is modifiable, so individual letters can be changed using array indexing syntax. (Actually fact the variable contents are writable is not without overhead; the string literal used to initialize the array is stored in a read-only part of the executable binary and is copied into the newly-allocated array at run-time.) A terminating zero-byte is also added to the array, so the array length implicit inside the square brackets is 6, not 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "A braced initializer can also be used with character literals as elements, so the same result could be achieved by using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "char name2[] = { 'D', 'i', 'n', 'a', 'h', '\\0' );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This time the terminating zero-byte has to be explicitly specified, if it is desired; both `name` and `name2` are safe to be put to streams such as `cout` as they each have this terminating zero-byte. A single element of each of these variables could also be output, and would produce the same output as a character literal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cout << name << '\\n'; // outputs \"Dinah\" followed by new-line\n",
    "cout << name[0];      // outputs \"D\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that the size of an array is known to the compiler, this size can be used in code. The Standard Library *function templates* `std::size()` and `std::size_bytes()` can be used to provide the number of array elements and amount of memory used, respectively. The value returned from either of these functions can be used in expressions declared with `constexpr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `size(name)` would return 6, while `size_bytes(numbers)` would return 20, assuming 32-bit `int`s. Older variants of C++ only provided the built-in `sizeof()` operator, which returns the same as `size_bytes()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Range-for\n",
    "\n",
    "We've previously seen that string literals can be output using `cout` without concerning ourselves with the details. The built-in `for` command can be used over a *range of values* applying the same operation(s) to each one in turn. This type of `for` statement is known as a *range-based for loop*, or range-for for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "A range-for statement can have two or three parts enclosed by parentheses. The initializer statement (the same as for `if` and `switch` statements) is the optional first part, and is followed, if present, with a **semi-colon**. Then follows the *for-loop variable* definition, which can be declared with either `auto` or with an explicit type, and with optional `const` (constant) and `&` (reference) or `&&` (universal reference) semantics. Then a **colon** separates this from the expression to be *iterated* over, known as the *range expression*. This program demonstrates simple use of a two-part range-for (without an initializer):"

Pointers can be `const` or point to `const` data, or both; they can also be typed or untyped (subscripting only works on typed pointers). In addition they can hold the value `nullptr` instead of a (hopefully valid) memory address.\n",

    "auto s1 = \"Dinah\";\n",
    "const char *s2 = \"Dinah\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case subscripting syntax can be used, in this case from zero up to five, and individual elements can be compared or output. Directly comparing the values of the two pointers, compares the memory addresses, not the value(s) they point to, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (s1[0] == s2[0]) { /*...*/ } // condition test evaluates to true\n",
    "if (s1 == s2) { /*...*/ }       // condition test (probably) evaluates to false\n",
    "                                // (your compiler may optimize the two data entities into one)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointer variables are defined using an asterisk in all cases (it is optional when using `auto`). An asterisk is also used to *dereference* a pointer, that is access the value it \"points to\".

    "* The size of the array called `str[]` is set by an integer constant, and this value is needed twice more in the program where it is accessible as `size(str)`, a compile-time value. An alternative way would be to use a constant or macro at each point the value is needed, and this is the only way to avoid repeated *magic constants* in older versions of C++ which did not provide `std::size()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function `cin.getline()` (actually the dot `.` indicates that `getline` is a *member function* of `cin`, more on these later) is called to read keyboard input into `str[]`. This reads input directly into the memory location provided by the first argument up to a maximum number of characters (including the zero terminator) as set by the second argument. A new-line character ('\\n') is never stored and any extra input which doesn't fit into `str[]` is saved for future calls to `cin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pointer `p` is set to the first character of `str[]`, and the type `const char *` specifies that we do not wish to modify it. In fact assigning an array to a (correctly typed) pointer is an implicit conversion, known as *array decay* because the size attribute is \"lost\". This also occurs when calling a function using an array as an argument, to either an array **or** pointer parameter. (In the same manner as `i` and `j` for temporary `int` variables, `p` is a common name for a pointer.)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **dereferenced** value `*p` is checked against zero by the `while` loop condition test, and if it is non-zero then it is sent to `cout` by the body of the `while` loop. The increment of `p` (actually a pre-increment, the one you should prefer given a choice) is necessary to prevent an infinite loop outputting the first character of `str[]`. This changes the value of `p` by one in order to point it towards the next character (of `str[]`), a process which repeats until the terminating zero-byte is reached. Importantly, `str[]` is left unchanged and remains able to be used again; this is the motivation for assigning `str` to a different (mutable) pointer variable `p`.\n",

    "A standard `for` loop is similar to a `while` loop in that it has a pre-condition test. A common historical use for `for` loops is to iterate over an array using subscript syntax, rather that pointers. A `for` loop has three parts enclosed within parentheses, any of which can be empty, each part separated by a semi-colon. The first part is an initializer, as in a three clause range-for loop. This typically initializes a single variable known as the *loop counter*, whose scope is the body of the `for` loop (only). The second part is the condition test, which functions exactly the same way as that in a `while` loop; if empty it evaluates to `true`, which causes an *infinite loop*. The third part is an iteration statement to be executed **after** each time the body of the loop has been executed.\n",
