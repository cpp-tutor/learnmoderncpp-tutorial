    "This `Person` class (here defined with `class` as opposed to the `struct` keyword we met in Chapter 6) contains three members: `dob` (itself of a user-defined type called `Date`), `familyname` and `firstname` (both of which are `std::string`s). We can define a variable of type `Person` (here `a_person`) using default-initialization syntax (the braces shown here are in fact optional, while empty parentheses are **not** permitted) but we cannot do a lot else with this object. Its fields will be zero-initialized for `a_person.dob.year`, `a_person.dob.month`, and `a_person.dob.day`, while `a_person.familyname` and `a_person.firstname` are empty strings. This is becuase the access specifier `private:` (which we also met in Chapter 6) is always implied for `class`es. This means we cannot either access the fields (member variables) directly using dot-notation, or use uniform initialization syntax, as with `genius`.\n",

    "* A constructor has the format *ClassName* ( *parameter-list* ) : *member initializers* { *possibly empty function body* } and does **not** have a return type declared.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The constructor's parameters have names `dob`, `familyname` and `firstname`, these being the same names as for the member variables (this is allowed in Modern C++). The conventions for naming (`private:`) class members vary, historically a trailing underscore is used, but this can become difficult to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The member variables are initialized using uniform initialization syntax; this forbids narrowing conversions, and there shouldn't be any as the parameter types should have been carefully chosen. (Older code may use parentheses here instead of braces.) The order of construction is the same as the way the member fields are laid out (in this class they are all after the `private:` access specifier); the order in the comma-separated initializers is unimportant (although you should try to replicate the order of the member fields, and your compiler will warn if they differ). The constructor's body is empty here (although it must be present), and this is not unusual.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `std::chrono::year_month_day` parameter (itself initialized by uniform initialization) is passed as `const`-reference instead of by value, as it is probably too big to fit in a single register to pass by value. The names are passed by value as `std::string_view` although in older code `const std::string&` would be common.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The member function `getName()` is declared `const` as it is guaranteed not to change any member variables. It returns a newly created `std::string` which must be returned by value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The member variable `dob` is declared `const` as it will never need to be changed; of course it needs to be initialized by the constructor, and this case is allowed. The member variables `familyname` and `firstname` need to be of type `std::string` (not `std::string_view` as for the constructor's parameters) for them to be guaranteed to exist for the lifetime of the class (consider factory functions which return a newly-constructed object, as we saw in Chapter 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The member function `getDob()` is also declared `const` and returns a `const`-reference. It is possible to put this return value directly to a `std::ostream` as the Standard Library overloads `operator<<` for `std::chrono::year_month_day`.\n",

Its meaning is the same as for `private:` except when inheritance is in use, when it means that (member functions defined within) derived classes have access to any members in the base class which were declared `protected:`. It's rare to find this in real code, although the next program we shall look at demonstrates its syntax and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike with the `struct`s we met in Chapter 6, *private inheritance* is the default for `class`es. This means that any members which were public in the base class are not visible to users of the derived class. The literature tells us that (public) inheritance describes an *is-a* relationship, while the much rarer private inheritance describes an *is-implemented-by* relationship. Typically, this means that a **privately** derived class must provide (public) member functions which in turn call member functions of the base class. Interestingly, this doesn't necessarily mean that the size and binary layout of the privately derived class is different from that of the base class, unless it has additional member variables.\n",

Often, you will want to make copies of these objects, whether its passing them to, or returning them from, functions, or storing them in a container. Sometimes they are passed by reference instead, and this is preferred for (larger) user-defined types, as passing by value has to cause a (potentially) expensive copy to be made. However the class designer needs to be aware of all of the copy and move operations that might be required of object instances, and must ensure they are implemented correctly.\n",

All of these can be explicitly declared `= default` or `= delete`. (We have already discovered that defining a constructor which takes parameters causes the default constructor to no longer be generated.) The other two constructors and the two assignment operators each come in two forms: copy and move, as shown in the next code fragment, using `Person` as the name of the class, and a code example of when the operation would be called. (The *boilerplate* code shown here can be copied verbatim for other `class`es, simply changing every occurence `Person` to the name of the class. The actual variable parameter name, often being `rhs`, has been omitted; these are the minimalist forms of the member function declarations.)"

However, the exception proves the rule, and I would suggest declaring the first five of these `= delete` when writing a new class, enabling them one by one with `= default` as any compiler errors present themselves, ensuring that objects can be copied and moved correctly. Most member variable types are compatible with default copy/move semantics, the obvious one that isn't being raw pointers. Writing custom special member functions for derived classes is sometimes tricky, as it involves manually invoking the correct special member function on the base class. (Hopefully you won't have to do this very often, further explanation is beyond the scope of this Tutorial.) Be aware that if the member variables (of a base or derived class) themselves obey the usual rules of copying (such as `int`, `double`, `std::string`, `std::shared_ptr<T>`, but not `char *` for example) then the `=default` special member functions will always work correctly.\n",

This probably doesn't sound too exciting, but is important in order for C++ to be classified as an object-**oriented** programming language, as opposed to merely object-**based**.

    "* To reduce code duplication, an overload of `operator<<` which handles `Shape::Point`s is provided (above the derived classes which use it).\n",
    "\n",
    "* All of the derived classes provide an implementation of `draw()`. In addition, `Circle` provides its own implementation of `getSides()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The definition of `Triangle` is the simplest of those which derive from `Shape` and represents an equilateral triangle; public inheritance needs to be specified as for all the other derived classes in this hierarchy. This class definition is qualified with the `final` keyword, which means that no class can derive from `Triangle` (it is therefore the \"final\" class of that inheritance \"branch\"). The constructors both call a `Shape` constructor. A single member variable `side` is defined which is used by the definition of `draw()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The definition of `Circle` is very similar to that of `Triangle`; this is a common theme with class heirarchies. It redefines `getSides()` in addition to defining and using a member variable `radius`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The definition of `Rectangle` defines two `protected:` member variables which are initialized by both constructors and output by `draw()`.\n",

Since `Rectangle`'s constructor calls that for `Shape`, neither of `Square`'s constructors need to call it directly. It can access the `protected:` member variables of `Rectangle` within its definition of `draw()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In `main()` a `std::vector<Shape*>` (vector of raw pointers to `Shape`) is created, and the populated with the return value from `new`; no intermediate pointer is used. (Since `Shape` is an abstract type it is not possible to create a `std::vector<Shape>`, as these would need to be able to be default-initialized in order for the container to be created.)\n",
